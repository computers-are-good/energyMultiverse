# Energy Multiverse

As the light from the distant room fades, you find yourself awake among darkness. And, in the distant, a faint glow of an unfamiliar light.

## About
Energy Multiverse is a work-in-progress browser game inspired by [Crank](https://faedine.com/games/crank/b39/). Gather energy, build spaceships, and explore the universe. Uncover the mystery of what happened to the world. Perhaps you could be the one to restore the multiverse?

## Things to do:
### Major:
- Finish the entire storyline
- Add more events to every planet type
- Add a "exotic refinery" which can appear in some systems. You need to give the exotic refinery some energy but it will make your ships stronger (increase hull).
- Add "boss ships" which need to be defeated to progress the story. The "boss ships" have a lot of health and you need to send multiple ships at it to defeat them.
## Minor:
- Add exotic energy as a resource: needed to jump between systems, has a 0.1% chance of being produced every time we make energy.
- Add more upgrades:
    - Turret damage
    - Missile damage
    - Missile speed
    - Mothership speed
    - fabriBot speed
    - Warp drive cost
    - Base hull for all ships
    - Base shield for all ships
