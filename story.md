Obviously this is going to spoil the entire story of the game; this is the draft document I use to write it!

Who cares about the "don't start a sentence with a preposition" rule lol what is that?

## story1

This is your tenth descent below the blanket of clouds. You've hit double digits already. You again feel the familar vibrations of your ship as it hurls into the depths of the unknown.

You appreciate the sublimity of the clouds coated in the golden glow of the sun. In between the glowing streaks from your ship, the horizon is coated in the gold of its distant star.

The scenery envelop you in transquility, and, as your ship slowly floats down towards the surface, you mind begins to drift to far away places.

Your mind's eye sees a universe far larger, a place where there are not hundreds of stars, but billions. And it in, you are on a blue marble around a star. It's your star.

And, of course, there are more like you. A place where billions of individuals like you move about from place to place in their day to day work, the hustle and bustle of their conversations whispering to you as they pass by. Must be wonderful being caught in the moment.

At this moment, a sudden alarm takes you out of your thoughts. LANDING GEAR FAILURE. Looks like this expedition has to end early.

As you pull up, you again take your mind to the distant world, a world hidden behind the shrouds of darkened glass in your mind. You picture yourself standing in the centre, where vast systems formed into galaxies whirl past you, leaving behind naught but a memory.

But does that place ever exist? You consider as you fly away.

## story2

From high above the atmosphere, you send your lilliputian craft into the depths. It's night on this side of the planet. Better be careful, you think to yourself. The red trails of your ship lights up the sky, but, in front of you, there is only an empty void.

Again you cast your mind to the distant universe. Does it really exist? And if it does, what's in the distant universe? Is it simply a realm of daydreams, or does it really exist beyond the confines of your mind?

You try to probe your head for details relating to the universe. Accompanied by the rattle of your spaceship, you push deeper into the abyss of the mind. And, you find three words staring back at you.

"Impending Energy Calamity."

## story3

It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the "Impending Energy Calamity" is, in fact, a very bad thing. Well, judging by the fact that you're alive and currently piloting a spaceship at eight kilometers per second down into the atmosphere of a strange new planet, you figured you probably survived the worse of it.

Of course, it is only natural now to wonder what the Impending Energy Calamity is. Suddenly, as if imparted by an entity beyond this universe, visions of that same distant world appear in your mind, its radiance blocking out the vast lands below.

Blades of the green populate an open plain as you stand in the darkness. When you gaze to the night sky above, you see the light from billions of stars  lighting up your world. It is as if a dream was reflected through the lens of the real.

The world between dream and nightmare blurs as a light above was extingushed by a force not known, the emptiness a reflection of a reality where it never existed.

Then, in a distant corner, another light darkens. Then another, and another, and another. It doesn't stop. Another one's gone. And another star. The one that glew the brightest is gone, and so is the one that's the dimmest. The biggest disappeared, and so did the smallest.

It keeps going. Soon, you are greeted by nothing but a pitch black sky and the audible echoes within your soul.

Your mind snaps back to the ever-shifting present, a reality where your feeble spaceship is about to cross the boundries between worlds. You gaze at the skies above; the stars wave at you as if they were never gone.

## story4

You awaken to the essence of nothingness; the world painted with the soul of oblivion and the silence of the night. The grass plain reduced from a mirror for the expression of the night sky to an apathetic maiden watching the world go by.

And you, a mere mortal witnessing the affair of the divine, left alone in the aphotic without a guidepost, patiently waiting for the sunrise of a new dawn to lead you away.

But that sunrise never came.

## story5

Yet, human ingenuity persists in the tide of change, for despite the odds against us, we adapted. We may not be able to restore the stars, but we will not give up. We coordinated and talked. We built our own suns, fusion reactors consuming swarms of hydrogen to light up the sky, their faint and distant glow a pathetic yet faithful mimicry of Sol.

We would turn them on and off to recreate the eternal cycle of day and night. We would suspend them from the clouds like the Old Sun. They provided guidance both for the distant and weary traveller and for the city dweller. Thus, there is again light in the world.

We reached for the night sky. The most brilliant scientists gathered to solve the puzzle of the darkness. We sent out probes; we sent out spaceships. Even then, the collective intelligence cannot solve the story of the stars.

Even then, we would live on in our new fake reality, our days marked by the little suns above. It is as if the old God was always there.

But, in the back of everyone's minds lies a lingering monster no one wishes to confront, a monster reminding us we will run out of hydrogen. We will run out of energy. And when that happens, the world will again return to darkness.
