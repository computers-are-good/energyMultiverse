## Story one

This is your tenth descent down into a planet. You've hit double digits already. You again feel the familar vibrations of the ship as it hurls into the depths of the atmosphere.

You appreciate the sublimity of the clouds coated in the golden glow of the sun. In between the glowing streaks from your ship, the horizon is coated in the goal of its distant star.

The scenery envelop you in transquility, and, as your ship slowly floats down towards the surface, you mind begins to drift to far away places.

You are taken back to a distant place, a universe far larger, a place where there are not hundreds of stars, but billions. And it in, you are on a blue marble around a star. It's your star.

And, of course, there are more like you. A place where billions of individuals like you move about from place to place in their day to day work, the hustle and bustle of their conversations whispering to you as they pass by. Must be wonderful being caught in the moment.

At this moment, a sudden alarm takes you out of your thoughts. LANDING GEAR FAILURE. Looks like this expedition has to end early.

As you pull up, you again take your mind to the distant world, a world hidden behind the shrouds of darkened glass in your mind. You picture yourself standing in the centre, where vast systems formed into galaxies whirl past you, leaving behind naught but a memory.

But does that place ever exist? You consider as you fly away.

## Story two

From high above the atmosphere, you send your lilliputian craft into the depths of darkness. It's night on this side of the planet. Better be careful, you think to yourself. The red trails of your ship lights up the sky, but, in front of you, there is only an empty void.

Again you cast your mind to the distant universe. Does it really exist? And if it does, what's in the distant universe? Is it simply a realm of daydreams, or does it really exist beyond the confines of your mind?

You try to probe your head for details relating to the universe. Accompanied by the rattle of your spaceship, you push deeper into the abyss of the mind. And, you find two words staring back at your face "Kinetic Labratories".

What could those words mean? You keep searching your mind for clues but nothing comes up. Then, out of the depths of darkness, you find three words staring you in the face.

"Impending Energy Calamity."

## Story three

It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the "Impending Energy Calamity" is, in fact, a very bad thing. Well, judging by the fact that you're alive and currently piloting a spaceship at eight kilometers per second down into the atmosphere of a strange new planet, you figured you probably survived the worse of it.

Of course, it is only natural now to wonder what the Impending Energy Calamity is. And how does that relate to the mysterious words, "Kinetic Labratories"? Suddenly, visions of that same distant world appear in your mind, with enough intensity to block out the vast lands below your spaceship.

You are standing on the top of the mountain in the darkness. When you gaze to the night sky above, you see the light from billions of stars from above lighting up your world. You bask in the transquility of the scene.

Suddenly, one of the lights just went ont. It was there a moment ago and now it's not. Then another, and another, and another.

The terrors of billions of individual just like you fills the world. It doesn't stop. Another one's gone. And another star. The one that glew the brightest is gone, and so is the one that's the dimmest. The biggest disappeared, and so did the smallest.

It keeps going. Soon, you are greeted by nothing but a pitch black sky with nothing in the sky. The vibrant night sky was reduced to darkness.

You snap back to reality. You gaze at the skies above, and are fortunate to see the faint glow of stars in the sky. There are not as many stars as in your mind, but you are glad their light can still reach you.
